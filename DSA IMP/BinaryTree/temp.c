 C code for following operations in binary three
 1. write all topics list in once below header file in comment
 2.  use if else in all function for different cases(with serial number of case) or conditions and mention condition or case in comment. 
 3. write serial number in comment with function name as given serial number and name 
 4. call every function from main function and write expected output with binaery tree after each function call in comment 
 5. write all important comments 
 6. if writing any helper function for any other function , mention that helper is for which function with serial number
 7. also write comment in main function of exoected output and binary tree in comment and mention which serial number you are using in main function
 8.  serial number of function should exact same as i have given , if you are making any other function mention it as helper function 
 9. declare all function just after create function
10. write everything end to end code as mentioned format 
 
 recheck all functions are correct and optimized  and commented expected output is correct 

 ### Advanced Operations:
35. convertToDoublyLinkedList  - Convert the binary tree to a doubly linked list
36. serializeTree              - Serialize the binary tree to a string
37. deserializeTree            - Deserialize the string back into a binary tree
38. checkFullBinaryTree        - Check if the tree is a full binary tree (each node has 0 or 2 children)
39. checkPerfectBinaryTree     - Check if the tree is a perfect binary tree (all internal nodes have 2 children, leaves at the same level)
40. convertToSumTree           - Convert the tree into a sum tree (each node contains the sum of its children)
41. buildTreeFromTraversals    - Reconstruct a tree from given inorder and preorder/postorder traversals
42. checkSubtree               - Check if a tree is a subtree of another binary tree
43. findAllPathsRootToLeaf     - Find and print all paths from the root to the leaf nodes
